# Oral Bridge OBT

AI-Assisted Bible Translation for Oral Communities

## What is this?

Oral Bridge helps translation teams create natural oral Bible translations. It uses AI to analyze biblical text and generate translations that sound natural when spoken aloud.

## How it works

The app guides you through 4 simple steps:

1. **Meaning Map** — AI analyzes the Bible passage structure
2. **Discourse** — AI adds narrative flow and connections
3. **Translation** — AI creates an oral translation in your target language
4. **Review** — AI checks accuracy and suggests improvements

## Getting Started

1. Open the app in your web browser
2. Enter your Claude API key
3. Type a Bible passage (example: Ruth 1:1-5)
4. Choose your target language and audience
5. Click "Start Translation"
6. Follow the steps — review each result before continuing
